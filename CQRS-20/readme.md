CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) was all the hype in .NET architecture circles a few years back. But has it faded away? Is it old news? I argue that it hasn't, and the concepts of CQRS are alive and well and probably more widely accepted and considered today than a few years ago. From event-driven systems to the Reactive Manifesto, the principles of CQRS are with us and impacting many different tools. In this session, we'll explore those CQRS principles and how they have manifested themselves in the architectures of choice today. You'll come away with a greater appreciation of CQRS and ideas on how to incorporate those principles in your applications today.
