Windows 10 now provides developers with a familiar Bash environment. This environment will allow users to: 


1. Run native Linux binaries including grep, sed, and awk 
2. Navigate a new Linux based file system using these commands 
3. Run bash shell scripts which rely on supported command line utilities 
 
Windows accomplishes this through the Windows Subsystem for Linux which allows Ubuntu user-mode binaries provided by Canonical to run on Windows 10. This means that the command line utilities are the same as those that run within a native Ubuntu environment. 

In this session we will showcase scripting, code editing / compilation, and execution of X11 apps compiled for Linux using a local X11 server from within the Bash on Ubuntu on Windows environment. 

We will then discuss the implications of these features as they relate to existing developer workflows. This will include a demonstration showcasing compilation of various programs using node.js, python, c++, asp.net, ruby and even a port of the original first person shooter Quake. 

We will also include a demonstration showing how to build and deploy a Ruby based web application from within Visual Studio Code using Bash on Ubuntu on Windows as an integrated terminal. Finally, we will show how to obtain the latest bits for Bash on Ubuntu on Windows that are shipped in the upcoming Windows 10 Anniversary update.
